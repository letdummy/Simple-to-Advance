            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can be
                stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such
                as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated
                and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. Learning to cope with stress in a healthy way will make
                you, the people you care about, and those around you become more resilient.
            </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Difficulty sleeping or nightmares</p>
                </li>

                    <p>Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Worsening of chronic health problems</p>

            <h2>Healthy Ways to Cope with Stress</h2>
            <ul>

                        media. It’s good to be informed, but hearing about the pandemic constantly can be upsetting.
                        Consider limiting news to just a couple times a day and disconnecting from phone, tv, and
                        computer screens for a while.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.</p>

                        in place, try connecting online, through social media, or by phone or mail.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Helping Others Cope</h2>
            <p>Taking care of yourself can better equip you to take care of others. During times of social distancing,
                it is especially important to stay connected with your friends and family. Helping others cope with
                stress through phone calls or video chats can help you and your loved ones feel less lonely or isolated.
